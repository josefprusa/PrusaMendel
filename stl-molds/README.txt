Open3DP - Forms for Mold Making

Open3DP.me.washington.edu

2011-Feb-21 Add new version of Mold_4_ZMotor Without bushings.
2011-Feb-21 Add new version of Mold_4_BushX6.
2011-Feb-21 Remove old Mold_4_ZMotor_W_BushX6.


2011-Feb-21 A new version of Mold_4_XMotor which does not require taping.

2011-Feb-18 This is the alpha release of these parts.  

2011-Feb-18 All forms are to be used directly except one must put tape across 
            one side of the whole Mold_4_XMotor in the motor/motor mounting holes
            region.   The tape acts as a separator to keep the mold material from 
            crossing through the form (thus making a one sided mold possible).
